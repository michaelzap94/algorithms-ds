//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS (DFS will take long)
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need to much memory)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS (DFS find an answer quicker)
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS -> this is what DFS is build for
//Finding the shortest path:
BFS -> BFS as it finds the closer nodes first
